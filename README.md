⚠️ Alert ⚠️:

First of all, you need to understand what are you doing and any possible consequences. Please note, that you can only use the frequencies you have a valid license for. In many countries you cannot operate any GSM RF equipment until a proper license from the regulatory authority is obtained. Running a BTS without such license and/or interfering with the commercial networks is out of law and may be punished!

git clone https://github.com/Mini0com/AutoCalypsoBTS-DragonOS.git && cd AutoCalypsoBTS-DragonOS && sudo bash install.sh
